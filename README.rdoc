= Ruby-GitHub

== DESCRIPTION:

Ruby-GitHub is a wrapper library for the GitHub v2 API. Most calls for Users, 
Organizations, Repositories, and Commits that do not require authentication are
now in place. 

REALLY basic support for authentication is in place on Repositories but it is 
not fully implemented yet.

== USAGE

I could write a bunch of examples here but every method in the code is 
commented, for now just please read the source. I will try and add more 
details here later.
